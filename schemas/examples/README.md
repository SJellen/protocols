## 🔍 Why URNs?

URNs (Uniform Resource Names):

- provide permanent, location-independent identifiers  
- do **not** imply hosting or require a URL  
- are common in IETF, W3C, and ISO specifications  
- allow schemas to remain stable even if repos, domains, or hosting change  

A URN is a **name**, not a link — ideal for protocol-grade specifications.
