# Protocols by Scott Jellen  
### RFC Series · Digital Public Infrastructure · Interoperability Standards  

This repository serves as the canonical source for my protocol work, RFC documents,  
schemas, and reference artifacts. It functions as a public, versioned archive for  
frameworks that define interoperable, humanity-first digital infrastructure.

The goal:  
**Author standards that make complex systems—sports, media, education, commerce—interoperable, portable, and governable.**

All whitepapers are DOI-backed via Zenodo.  
All RFCs are maintained in plain-text Markdown for transparency, citation stability, and long-term accessibility.

## 📡 RFC Series

### **RFC 0001 — The Universal Sports Graph**  
*A protocol for rights, reach, and real-time access.*

Defines a machine-readable rights registry, a universal Access API, and a neutral clearinghouse for settlement and auditability.

- **DOI (Whitepaper):** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17537287  
- **RFC Markdown:** [`/rfc/rfc-0001-universal-sports-graph.md`](./rfc/rfc-0001-universal-sports-graph.md)

Additional RFCs will be added as formal protocol designs evolve.

## 📘 Whitepapers (Source Markdown)

Markdown source files corresponding to published whitepapers are stored in `/whitepapers/`.  
All canonical PDF versions (with DOIs) are available on Zenodo:

This repo holds the **source layer**—the editable, version-controlled foundation for each paper.

## 🧪 Schemas & Reference Specifications

Schemas define the interface contracts for RFC implementations.  
All schemas use **URN identifiers** for long-term stability and independence from hosting or domains.

Includes:

- **Event Schema** (`urn:usg:schema:event:1.0`)  
- **Entitlement Token Schema** (`urn:usg:schema:entitlement-token:1.0`)  
- **Settlement Record Schema** (`urn:usg:schema:settlement-record:1.0`)  

See the schema registry:  
[`/schemas`](./schemas)

## 📊 Architectural Diagrams

Blueprint diagrams and structural visuals used across RFCs and whitepapers.  
These represent protocol architecture, governance models, audit stacks, and flow sequences.
