# Protocols by Scott Jellen  
### RFC Series · Digital Public Infrastructure · Interoperability Standards  

This repository contains the source files, RFCs, schemas, and reference materials  
for my protocol and digital-public-infrastructure work.

The goal:  
**Define interoperable, humanity-first standards for rights, access, media, and institutional architecture.**

All whitepapers are DOI-backed and published via Zenodo.  
All RFCs are maintained in plain-text markdown for transparency and versioning.
